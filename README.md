# Epidemiology Inspired Rumor Modeling

This repository archives my project done for MATH 2552 Differential Equation at Georgia Tech. A nonlinear differential equation system and two variations were constructed for modeling rumor spread in a metaphoric scenario. I used the odeint function in Scipy library to numerically solve for the solutions and seaborn to plot the results. This repository contains the code, images in the report and the report pdf.

The LaTeX file for the report can be viewed at: https://www.overleaf.com/read/qqbqtdmncvjs
